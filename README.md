# Analyzing and Improving Customer Ratings for Subway Stores

### Overview
This project investigates customer satisfaction and ratings for Subway stores across the U.S., aiming to identify strategies for improving average ratings to meet a target of 4.5/5. Using real-world datasets, I analyzed online reviews and restaurant details to uncover trends, address concerns, and propose actionable solutions to enhance customer experience and store performance.

### Problem Statement
Subway's CEO, John Chidsey, raised concerns about low customer ratings, particularly a store near company headquarters in Milford, CT, which has an average rating of 3.2/5. This project explores whether the ratings across all stores indicate a similar trend and provides insights to help Subway achieve its ambitious target.

### Datasets
1. **Review Dataset**: Contains ~400,000 user ratings for ~2,000 restaurants, including the date of each review.
2. **Restaurant Dataset**: Includes restaurant details such as name, category, city, and state.

### Objectives
- Analyze customer rating patterns to determine national and regional trends.
- Compare Subway's ratings to competitors in the sandwich category.
- Evaluate the feasibility of achieving an average rating of 4.5/5 across all stores.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer satisfaction.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying and aggregating data from the datasets.
- **Excel**: For summarizing and presenting key insights.

### Key Insights
- Identified trends in customer satisfaction based on geographic location and time of review.
- Analyzed patterns of extreme ratings (high and low) to evaluate their impact on overall averages.
- Benchmarked Subwayâ€™s performance against competitors in the sandwich industry.

### Results
- Found actionable insights to target specific areas with low ratings.
- Developed recommendations to improve operational efficiency and customer service.
- Provided a realistic assessment of achieving the target average rating of 4.5/5.
